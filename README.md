Smoking & Cancer Risk Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes smoking behavior and its relationship with health outcomes by combining adult smoking & cancer data with youth smoking and drug experimentation data.
The goal is to explore patterns, risk indicators, and social factors associated with smoking across different age groups.

Datasets Used

Smoking & Cancer Risk Dataset
Focuses on adult smoking habits, health symptoms, cancer type, and survival data.
Youth Smoking and Drug Dataset
Explores smoking prevalence among young people and its relationship with drug experimentation, peer influence, and prevention factors.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook


Analysis Steps

Data loading and inspection

Data cleaning (missing values, text standardization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Group comparisons and correlations

Visualization of key patterns

Key Insights

Current and former smokers show higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms compared to never smokers.

Former smokers tend to have long smoking histories, highlighting long-term exposure risks.

Among youth, smoking prevalence and drug experimentation show very weak correlation, suggesting different influencing factors.

Peer influence, school programs, and access to counseling show only minor variation in smoking prevalence, indicating that prevention strategies may require deeper behavioral and social analysis.
